        <h1>How to make a paper bird
            <ol>
                <li>Using a square piece of paper, fold the paper in half to form a triangle. If using a piece of paper colored on one side only, begin with the colored side facing up. Unfold the paper and repeat to make the folds seen in the image above.</li>
<li>Flip the paper so the colored side is facing down and fold the paper in half forming a rectangle. 
    Unfold the paper and repeat to make the folds seen in the image above.</li>
<li>Now fold along all four creases at once to form a square with the open end facing you.</li>
                <li>Fold two edges in, to form a kite shape on top. Repeat on the other side.</li>
                <li>Fold the point down and crease above the other two folds. Flip the paper and repeat the fold. Undo the folds you made in steps 4 and 5.</li>            
                <li>Pull the bottom corner (top layer only) up above the top corner. Fold along the creases you made in steps 4 and 5. Repeat on the other side.</li>
                <li>Figure the rest out I guess</li>
